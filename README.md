===========

Error is traced down from UserInput -> GameEntity.translate(...)

Must run in GWT to reproduce.

Another error
=============
for some reason the monster modelinsance animates to the side instead of up and down like I made it do in blender, I'll add the .blend file in the android/assest/data/monster directory
